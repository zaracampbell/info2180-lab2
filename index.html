                <p>It's been a month since my last blog and since I went back to school. I am officially a second-year IT student, and it's been a mix of excitement and anxiety. I've made a few new friends, which has been great, but I still tend to spend most of my time with my long-time friends, those who know me best. The sense of familiarity is comforting, especially when things get overwhelming. The courses this year are much more challenging than in the first year. There’s definitely more workload and more projects. At times, it feels like there aren’t enough hours in the day to get everything done. I’ve had moments of doubt, ups and downs, but I keep reminding myself why I’m here. I’m doing this for my future and for my mom, who’s been my biggest inspiration and support. I just want to make her proud.</p>
                <p>As the year progresses, I’m hoping for the best. I’ve set goals for myself to pass all my exams and keep improving my skills. I hope I’ll continue making new friends, maybe even find time to go out more and explore new things outside of school. Even though the road ahead seems tough, I’m staying optimistic. I’m determined to make the most of this opportunity and give it everything I’ve got. Here's to hoping for a year full of growth, learning, and success!</p>

                <h2>The Beginning of Second-Year</h2>

                <p>I don't know if I should be excited or worried. I am going into my second year of university, and it feels surreal. Time has flown by so fast. It’s hard to believe that just a year ago, I was a nervous freshman, unsure of what to expect. I remember starting university like it was yesterday, every detail still fresh in my mind. The rush of excitement, the nerves, the endless possibilities ahead of me. I remember going to orientation, walking around campus, and feeling absolutely starstruck. It was as if I had stepped into a new world, a world where I would start building the foundation of my future. And now, here I am, going into my second year. Part of me is excited about what's to come, the chance to dive deeper into my courses, to tackle new challenges, and to continue growing both academically and personally. I’ve made it this far, and I know that I have the ability to handle what's ahead.</p>
                <p>One thing’s for sure, this second year will be a defining one. It’s the year where I’ll truly start shaping my future, where the decisions I make and the effort I put in will start to have a lasting impact. I’m excited to see what this year has in store for me and I hope to venture into new things and make some new friends. Happy New School Year to you all and I hope all goes well. God bless you all.</p>
